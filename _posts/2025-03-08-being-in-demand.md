### From academia to industry: my journey
For much of my career, I believed I would never leave academia. At one point, it felt like academia was all I knew. I got my PhD in Coral Reef Ecology in 2013 studying Colombian coral reefs ([Bayraktarov et al. 2012](https://www.icrs2012.com/proceedings/manuscripts/ICRS2012_9A_2.pdf);  [Eidens et al. 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisa_Bayraktarov/publication/265251223_Seasonal_upwelling_stimulates_primary_production_of_Colombian_Caribbean_coral_reefs/links/540662ed0cf2c48563b24f4f.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=WC3xWXY3DsD73VOvwRApcAcT9m.ipopnd8LacyCNdHI-1741421778-1.0.1.1-JrMVr47T4eiAkt5d8.fTtfXSFuIVBVpgBWwGp4MMou0); [Bayraktarov et al. 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080536);  [Bayraktarov et al. 2014a](https://peerj.com/articles/397/), [2014b](https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/36306/1/Bayraktarov-etal_2014.pdf), [2014c](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-014-3647-3), [2014d](http://www.biogeosciences.net/11/2977/2014/bg-11-2977-2014.html); [Eidens et al. 2014](https://peerj.com/articles/554/); [Eidens et al. 2015](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2015.00002/full); [Plass-Johnson et al. 2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9499-2_9)). Afterwards, I moved to Brisbane, Australia, to try my luck as an early career researcher. My first role was as a Research Assistant at the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, with a contract of just 150 hours (yes, hours – not days). This was followed by several short-term positions, ranging from a few months to a maximum of two years.

During this time, I engaged in fascinating projects, such as analysing seagrass samples ([Saunders et al. 2015](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/bot-2014-0060/html)), compiling literature data to create a cost and feasibility database for marine coastal restoration projects ([Bayraktarov et al. 2015](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/15-1077); [Bayraktarov et al. 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec.12977); [Bayraktarov et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228477)), and conducting fieldwork to study the interactions between coral and algae under climate change and eutrophication. One of my most challenging and rewarding projects was developing Australia’s Threatened Species Index ([Bayraktarov et al. 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00239/full); [Bayraktarov et al. 2021](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.322); [Bayraktarov et al. 2021](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.443)), which involved integrating data on threatened species trends into a multi-species visualisation tool – a powerful communication resource telling us how Australia’s threatened species are going (check it out at [tsx.org.au](https://tsx.org.au/)).

Overall, I spent about seven years as a PostDoc, working on various short-term contracts (each less than two years) across projects in conservation data science, biodiversity indicators, and marine coastal restoration. While I loved the research, the constant cycle of short-term contracts, funding uncertainties, and the elusive tenure track began to weigh on me. It was a sobering reality in the highly competitive world of academia.

Then, I made a shift. A project partner head-hunted me for a role as an Innovations Program Manager at Griffith University. The position description was pretty intimidating, so it took some encouragement to actually dare to apply. “Don’t worry, Elisa, this role is just like managing the Threatened Species Index – just a bit bigger. You’ve got this.”, he said. That’s when the penny dropped, and I started thinking about how my academic skills would translate into what’s needed to be a program manager.

*Extensive experience in managing information systems and infrastructure?* Yep, I did that for the Threatened Species Index. *Managing a geographically dispersed team?* Absolutely! I coordinated two Research Assistants based in Melbourne and a Software Developer who built the infrastructure for the tool. *Experience at the intersection of science and IT, data acquisition, and analysis?* That’s literally what I’d been doing for the past seven years – just in business lingo. *Developing innovative solutions and strategically driving projects to meet diverse needs?* C’mon, isn’t that the bread and butter of every academic?

So, I learned the language of the job ad and applied it to my application materials – and got the job. Three and a half years later, the team I led developed the EcoCommons Australia platform ([Bayraktarov et al. 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815224003165)), and I was ready for a new challenge. With my newfound confidence, I realised my academic skills were in high demand, and I could easily transition into industry and kiss academia goodbye.

Eventually, I found myself in a position I now consider my dream job – [Data & Science Manager}(https://www.natureaustralia.org.au/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/elisa-bayraktarov/) at The Nature Conservancy, the world’s largest environmental non-governmental organisation.

Reflecting on my career, I realise it wasn’t a straight path at all. I feel I did a lot of random bits and pieces, often unsure of where the journey would lead. Sometimes, it felt like it took me too long – landing my first ongoing job at 41 felt like growing up late to enjoy the beauty of financial stability (e.g., buying a house, getting married, paying a mortgage…). Along the way, I battled a lot of imposter syndrome – that nagging feeling of inadequacy or feeling like a fraud despite evident success and numerous achievements in my roles (you can read more about strategies for [overcoming imposter syndrome](https://elisabayra.github.io/2023/08/07/overcoming-imposter.html) in my blog here).

Over the past couple of years, I’ve received numerous invitations to speak to students about my journey from academia to industry. I enjoy helping them see how their skills are not just valuable but in demand beyond academia.

So, I decided to write this little guide for those wondering, "What’s next?" – and how to get there.

### What jobs are in demand for the next 10 years?

I recently came across the World Economic Forum’s [Future of Jobs Report 2025](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/), which highlights the most in-demand jobs and skills for the 2025-2030 period. The report is based on an extensive survey of over 1,000 global employers, representing more than 14 million workers across 22 industry clusters and 55 economies. The survey results were complemented by data from ADP (a payroll system), Coursera, Indeed, and LinkedIn. The report captures perspectives and insights into the jobs most in demand. These jobs are shaped by technology changes, the green transition (e.g., investing in renewables, electric vehicles, and sustainable production methods like green steel), societal issues, economic uncertainty, demographic shifts (e.g., changes in gender, age, birth rates, and population distribution), and geoeconomic fragmentation (the growing restriction of international trade and financial transactions to countries that are politically aligned).

Some of the fastest-growing roles include:

* AI and Big Data Specialists
* Environmental & Renewable Energy Engineers
* Cybersecurity Analysts
* Sustainability Experts
* Education & Training Specialists
* Project and Program Managers
* Healthcare and Social Work Professionals
* Logistics & Supply Chain Specialists

Notice something? Many of these align closely with skills acquired during a PhD, especially in environmental science.
