## Being in Demand – A Transition Guide for (Young) Academics

40 under 40 is a list by the [Fortune magazine](https://fortune.com/ "Official Webpage of Fortune Magazine") on the most influential young leaders of the year in the tech industry. Their list doesn't expand to scientists or anyone working outside of tech and has been often criticized as being subjective about power and influence. Today, exactly 40 days before my 40th birthday, I reflect on my life as a female scientist, a woman, and a human. I ponder about what may lie ahead of me. These are my very personal musings on my life's professional and personal achievements, where to next and what I would have loved to tell my 20 years-old self. Although, I've had the honour of crossing paths with many incredible people, I only mention a few selected individuals who have had the greatest impact on where my journey has taken me. I am eternally grateful!

### From Academia to Industry: My Journey
For much of my career, I believed I would never leave academia. At one point, it felt like academia was all I knew. I got my PhD in Coral Reef Ecology in 2013 studying Colombian coral reefs ([Bayraktarov et al. 2012](https://www.icrs2012.com/proceedings/manuscripts/ICRS2012_9A_2.pdf);  [Eidens et al. 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisa_Bayraktarov/publication/265251223_Seasonal_upwelling_stimulates_primary_production_of_Colombian_Caribbean_coral_reefs/links/540662ed0cf2c48563b24f4f.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=WC3xWXY3DsD73VOvwRApcAcT9m.ipopnd8LacyCNdHI-1741421778-1.0.1.1-JrMVr47T4eiAkt5d8.fTtfXSFuIVBVpgBWwGp4MMou0); [Bayraktarov et al. 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080536);  [Bayraktarov et al. 2014a](https://peerj.com/articles/397/), [2014b](https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/36306/1/Bayraktarov-etal_2014.pdf), [2014c](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-014-3647-3), [2014d](http://www.biogeosciences.net/11/2977/2014/bg-11-2977-2014.html); [Eidens et al. 2014](https://peerj.com/articles/554/); [Eidens et al. 2015](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2015.00002/full); [Plass-Johnson et al. 2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9499-2_9)). Afterwards, I moved to Brisbane, Australia, to try my luck as an early career researcher. My first role was as a Research Assistant at the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, with a contract of just 150 hours (yes, hours – not days). This was followed by several short-term positions, ranging from a few months to a maximum of two years.

During this time, I engaged in fascinating projects, such as analysing seagrass samples ([Saunders et al. 2015](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/bot-2014-0060/html)), compiling literature data to create a cost and feasibility database for marine restoration projects ([Bayraktarov et al. 2015](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/15-1077); [Bayraktarov et al. 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec.12977); [Bayraktarov et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228477)), and conducting fieldwork to study the interactions between coral and algae under climate change and eutrophication. One of my most challenging and rewarding projects was developing Australia’s Threatened Species Index ([Bayraktarov et al. 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2018.00239/full); [Bayraktarov et al. 2021](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.322); [Bayraktarov et al. 2021](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.443)), which involved integrating data on threatened species trends into a multi-species visualisation tool – a powerful communication resource telling us how Australia’s threatened species are going (check it out at [tsx.org.au](https://tsx.org.au/)).

Overall, I spent about seven years as a PostDoc, working on various short-term contracts (each less than two years) across projects in conservation data science, biodiversity indicators, and marine coastal restoration. While I loved the research, the constant cycle of short-term contracts, funding uncertainties, and the elusive tenure track began to weigh on me. It was a sobering reality in the highly competitive world of academia.

Then, I made a shift. A project partner head-hunted me for a role as an Innovations Program Manager at Griffith University. The position description was pretty intimidating, so it took some encouragement to actually dare to apply. “Don’t worry, Elisa, this role is just like managing the Threatened Species Index – just a bit bigger. You’ve got this.” That’s when the penny dropped, and I started thinking about how my academic skills would translate into what’s needed to be a program manager.

*Extensive experience in managing information systems and infrastructure?* Yep, I did that for the Threatened Species Index. *Managing a geographically dispersed team?* Absolutely! I coordinated two Research Assistants based in Melbourne and a Software Developer who built the infrastructure for the tool. *Experience at the intersection of science and IT, data acquisition, and analysis?* That’s literally what I’d been doing for the past seven years – just in business lingo. *Developing innovative solutions and strategically driving projects to meet diverse needs?* C’mon, isn’t that the bread and butter of every academic?

So, I learned the language of the job ad and applied it to my application materials – and got the job. Three and a half years later, my team developed the EcoCommons platform ([Bayraktarov et al. 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815224003165)), and I was ready for a new challenge. With my newfound confidence, I realised my academic skills were in high demand, and I could easily transition into industry and kiss academia goodbye.

Eventually, I found myself in a position I now consider my dream job – [Data & Science Manager}(https://www.natureaustralia.org.au/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/elisa-bayraktarov/) at The Nature Conservancy, the world’s largest environmental non-governmental organisation.

Reflecting on my career, I realise it wasn’t a straight path at all. I feel I did a lot of random bits and pieces, often unsure of where the journey would lead. Sometimes, it felt like it took me too long – landing my first ongoing job at 41 felt like growing up late to enjoy the beauty of financial stability (e.g., buying a house, getting married, paying a mortgage…). Along the way, I battled a lot of imposter syndrome – that nagging feeling of inadequacy or feeling like a fraud despite evident success and numerous achievements in my roles (you can read more about strategies for [overcoming imposter syndrome](https://elisabayra.github.io/2023/08/07/overcoming-imposter.html) in my blog here).

Over the past couple of years, I’ve received numerous invitations to speak to students about my journey from academia to industry. I enjoy helping them see how their skills are not just valuable but in demand beyond academia.

So, I decided to write this little guide for those wondering, "What’s next?" – and how to get there.







Leading up to my 20ies, I seemed like someone who probably could have been described as a rebel. This was probably my response to being a stranger in my own 'new' country as my family had moved from Bulgaria to (Western) Germany when I was 8. Day in, day out I was faking being a German, so I don't get bullied at school and eventually, I perfected my 'germanisms' including my accent-free German language. And I did look like a rebel too - long hair, black clothes, leather and of course, my beautiful 125ccm Yamaha TDR motorbike that I got when I was 16. During most of my teenage years, I listened to Heavy Metal, went to Metal live gigs, played role and live-action role plays, while pursuing the dream of becoming an astronaut. The love for reaching for the stars must have come from the time when I got notified that I was the best pupil of my school and hence eligible to participate at the Deutsche Schueller Akademie. I took part in an one-week long retreat for bright students - doing a workshop on the 'Anatomy of the Universe'. And to be honest, at that stage of my life, I really felt, I’d rather be in a profession that gets me as far away as possible from masses of people. At some stage, I even met the German Physicist and Astronaut, [Ulf Merbold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulf_Merbold "Ulf Merbold's Wikipedia page") and managed to ask him what I could do to become an Astronaut. He said: "Go study Science! Study the most difficult scientific subject that you can find!" So, I did.

### My 20ies and the search for a purpose in life
I enrolled in Biophysics with 10 other crazy humans and moved from Frankfurt to Berlin in 2002 - home of the Humboldt University and probably the best city in Germany with its arts, theatres, music, underground scene and diversity of people from all countries and cultures. Berlin truly is Germany's melting pot for creativity. Biophysics, or the Physics of Dynamic Biological Systems was hard. We were expected to obtain our certificates together with the pure Physicists, the Biologists and the Informaticians but we didn’t have the time to focus entirely on any of those subjects. It was quite overkill. After obtaining the German Vordiplom (BSc), I really needed a break and obtained a grant to study abroad with the Erasmus/Socrates program for a year. I chose the Canary Islands. Here, I learned Spanish, Diving and a bit of Surfing. Perhaps not the most studious period of my life but I made some incredible friendships that lasted a lifelong and saw places that were beautiful beyond comprehension like the [Anaga Mountains](https://www.canaryislandsinfo.co.uk/tenerife/things-to-do/anaga-mountains/ "Anaga Mountains") in Tenerife. Eventually, I finished my Diplom (MSc) in Biophysics in 2008 specialising in Membrane Biophysics. In fact, my thesis discovered some quite important information about the [Influenza virus fusion](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(10)00524-2 "Paper on Influenza virus fusion") which would inform what part of the cellular membrane we should be targeting with antiviral drugs. 

That same year, I interviewed at the European Space Agency, however, wasn't successful. After 15 years of hard work on the pursuit of becoming an Astronaut and witnessing this dream burst into pieces threw me straight into an existential crisis and the search for my life's purpose. The continuing search led me to the [Hydra Field Station](http://ifmw.de/en/index.php/ "Webpage of Hydra Institute") on Elba in Italy where I initially participated in a diving training for university students on the 'Methods of Underwater Research'. There it was! A new dream and vocation were born! I didn’t become an Astronaut but I was on the best way of becoming an Aquanaut! I've spent the next several months training at Hydra in preparation for an European Scientific Diver training. I had secured a slot in the 5-weeks professional training at the Alfred-Wegener Institute on Helgoland. Helgoland is a cold and stormy place in the North Sea - it's the best place to get challenged by the elements! And that got me thinking that I'd really like to study the Ocean with a focus on field work. 

Shortly after finishing the professional diver training, I started the study of Marine Microbiology at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen in 2008. Bremen is undeniably the Mecca of Marine Science in Germany with its Max Planck, Leibniz, Alfred-Wegener Institute and Bremen Uni. This second MSc opened my eyes for international collaboration and how it is to work and learn at a very well-funded research institute. I finished my degree specialising in Marine Biogeochemistry and specifically studying [bacteria in shallow-water hydrothermal vents](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00111/full "Paper on bacteria in hydrithermal vents") which were totally adapted to their low-PhD environment. Max Planck also provided the connection to a bright marine scientist, now [Dr Duygu Sevilgen](https://centrescientifique.mc/en/annuaire-scientifique/fiche/duygu-sevilgen "Duygu's profile in Monaco"), who took me as a Diver and Research Assistant, first to Helgoland and then to the Arctic, to study the impacts of climate change on microphytobenthos (little algae that live at the marine sediment surface) by using the fanciest ever underwater microsensors. I remember being surrounded by beautiful sunlight at 2am at night and pondering what the heck should I be doing with my life, so that I can live a life with a purpose. The best part of my deployment in Ny Alesund, Svaldbard was meeting incredible people from all over the world doing fascinating stuff. I met folks from several research organisations, National Geographics and Greenpeace. After the Arctic field work, I went from the snow into the tropics. I travelled for one month through Malaysia and encountered the sheer beauty of coral reefs. Little did I know that coral reefs would captivate me for the next several years to come! In 2010, I started a PhD in Coral Reef Ecology at the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Ecology but was permanently deployed in Santa Marta, Colombia to study the [coral reef ecosystem of Tayrona National Park in the Colombian Caribbean](https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=oai%5C%3Aelib.suub.uni-bremen.de%5C%3ADISS%5C%2F00103499 "Elisa's Dissertation"). I know, I would have never succeeded if it wasn't for the help and mentorship of my Colombian supervisor, [Dr Valeria Pizarro](https://www.perryinstitute.org/staff/dr-valeria-pizarro "Valeria's profile at Perry Institute"), who is still an integral part of my life. 


### My mid-30ies and finding ground under my feet as an academic
After 2 years, 9 months and [7 scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=KnhRFbQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate "Elisa's Google Scholar"), I could finally call myself Dr Bayraktarov – a Doctor of coral reefs. In 2013, I followed my love who had moved from Colombia to Australia to start his PhD. For me, a new chapter was about to begin – the hunt for highly attractive and competitive postdoctoral jobs in coral reef ecology. It didn’t make it any easier that I was an outsider, and no one had heard my name before. And then I was also trying to find employment at some of Australia’s most prestigious universities for ecology in Brisbane. 

In 2014, I was successful finding a job as a Research Assistant at the Global Change Institute, which back then was a new institute to create change based at the University of Queensland. This is when my collaboration (later mentorship and then friendship) with the wonderful [Dr Megan Saunders](http://megsaunders.github.io "Megan's webpage") began. Megan introduced me to the study of seagrass and put me on a project to start developing a database integrating information from published papers, reports and webpages on the [cost and feasibility of marine coastal restoration](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/15-1077 "Cost and feasibility paper from 2016"). I will never forget the trust Megan put in me when she asked me to step up and lead this paper while she was in maternity with her first child. Over the course of 1.5 years, I had become an expert in Marine Coastal Restoration. And I really wished, I would have pursued this direction of research. But instead, I decided to write a crazy grant application for an Endeavour Fellowship that would allow me to study the multi-factor effects of climate change and eutrophication on the interaction between corals and algae on Heron Island in the Southernmost part of the Great Barrier Reef. The grant was successful and sent me for four months to Heron Island where I worked 10-hrs days with no weekends on an experiment that received little attention or interest from my supervisors and probably led to breaking my relationship and deteriorating my mental health. The work, despite of producing some surprising results around the winners and losers of the climate change and eutrophication game, never got published. It reminds me of my time on ‘Prison Paradise’ (aka Heron Island).

2016 came with another, this time a scientific identity crisis. I participated at the largest coral reef conference in the World which was organised in Hawaii. Thousands of coral reef researchers who could afford the high registration fees and travel had gathered and all they were saying was that we need many more grants to do much more research to better understand coral reefs. I couldn’t believe it. It was a mass coral bleaching year for the Great Barrier Reef and all that these folks wanted was more experiments! Not many were talking about that there’s enough data and that we need to do something (e.g., climate action, active adaptive management, nature-based solutions, restoration…) now before it’s too late for our World’s corals. I think, this must have been one of these light bulb moments where I turned my back on field work and experiments and decided to dedicate the next coming years of my career to Conservation Data Science. 

In 2016, I would have probably left Australia for good if it wasn’t for one of the greatest mentors in my life, [Prof Hugh Possingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Possingham "Hugh’s Wikipedia page"). Hugh convinced me to stay and take on a job, initially as a Research Assistant and then as a PostDoc developing Australia’s and the Worlds-first [Threatened Species Index](https://tsx.org.au/ "Webpage of the Threatened Species Index"). I remember that there was quite a bit of a pushback, especially from the Federal Government that funded the project. There seemed to be this mantra that there’s not enough standardised data from repeated monitoring on threatened species out there. And in way, that was true. This data was sitting on people’s computers and within reports. So my job required me to talk to over 300 data custodians about datasets on 254 bird, mammal, and plant species from over 20,000 locations across Australia, and from more than 400,000 surveys carried out over 50 years. And I had to convince them to share their gold with a common good project looking into how our threatened species are going. This required extroversion. It required confidence to engage with stakeholders. I had none of these qualities and was haunted by an everlasting imposter syndrome. And then, presented with the option of either to resign or grow, I chose to do the most terrifying thing that could have come to my mind. I decided to learn how to perform in front of an audience by making up a scene on the go inspired by whatever the audience throws at me. It’s called Improvised Theatre. I started my improvised theatre training initially with a Brisbane Group called [Impro Mafia](https://www.impromafia.com/ "Webpage of Impro Mafia") in 2016 and later with [Cam Percy](https://www.campercy.com/ "Cam’s webpage") and her Impro Club. 

Impro teaches you to:
-	Embrace failure – it’s not that bad
-	Believe in yourself and trust that you have everything you need to wing every and any situation
-	Accept ‘gifts’ by adopting a “Yes-and” mentality
-	How people react to your body language
-	Trust your people – they will catch you if you fall
-	To become an attentive listener
-	To play, be silly and laugh

It was 2 years of incredibly hard work, and I had the opportunity to work closely with environmental non-governmental organisations, state/territories governments, natural resource management bodies, species recovery teams and many brilliant scientists. In 2018, we released the first iteration of the TSX – a [Threatened Species Index for Australia’s birds](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/csp2.322 "Paper to TSX for birds"). Mammals followed in 2019 and Plants in 2020 - the latter spearheaded by the wonderful [Dr Micha Jackson](https://cbcs.centre.uq.edu.au/profile/193/micha-jackson "Micha's profile at CBCS"). Probably the most rewarding moments of my academic career were when I heard that the Federal Government of Australia had adopted the TSX as their very official reporting tool on threatened species status. And then, about one year later, continuation funding for the project, now under a new management through the [Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](http://www.nrm.gov.au/regional-land-partnerships "Webpage of Regional Land Partnerships Program") and [TERN](https://www.tern.org.au/ "TERN’s webpage") appeared.

In May 2020, I left academia for good. After creating my reputation through the TSX, one of my project partners urged me to apply for a job as a Program Manager to lead the development of the digital innovation platform called [EcoCommons Australia](https://www.ecocommons.org.au/ "Webpage of EcoCommons Australia").


### Leaving academia for impact (and feeling like an imposter)
Leaving academia is hard. Especially for those of us who haven’t known anything else in their lives. But like with everything in life, even academic skills are highly transferrable. It just takes a whole deal of courage to do the move and apply for the job. I probably wouldn’t have applied for the job as EcoCommons’ Program Manager if it wasn’t for my collaborator who encouraged me to do so. The good news is that, with the transition, there will be an increase in salary demonstrating that our academic staff, especially in their early career years, are rarely valued enough for what they bring to the table. Once I knew, I was going to change jobs, I needed to start working on getting my work-life balance in check and working through my imposter syndrome with my psychologist. It was surprising how simple the solutions to these problems are. To achieve work-life balance, you need to start saying “No” to requests more often (assuming you have a supportive work environment and are not working two jobs at once because of staff resignations). And the imposter syndrome can only be cured by collecting evidence on your achievements. So why not starting a ‘Book of Winning’ with snippets on everything great that you’ve achieved throughout your career or writing a blog like this. Now, two years into my management job, I feel that an academic can create a much bigger impact if they come down from their ivory tower of academia and started working on things that are badly needed. This would lead to real impact for the animals and places we love. In my case, EcoCommons is meant to become the platform of choice for ecological and environmental problem solving and empowering researchers and practitioners with data, scientific workflows, and infrastructure to protect and restore the planet. I feel, a job like that would allow me to have much more impact than if I would have chosen to write scientific papers that probably not many read. Sometimes we are lucky with the papers we write, and they are being picked up by e.g., a billionaire who’s exploring the best and most cost-efficient ways of restoring coral reefs. This happened to me once when I received an email from MARS Inc CEO, Frank Mars who had been running a 10+ years [coral reef restoration program](https://www.mars.com/news-and-stories/articles/coral-reef-rehabilitation "Mars restores coral reefs") in Indonesia – which is where they extract fish for petfood and cocoa for chocolates. But of course, the farmers growing cocoa want to eat fish, so it makes sense to restore coral reefs as they would bring back the fish. Yes, I acknowledge that it’s scary to transition. But if you’re an Early Career Researcher, take a moment to really think about whether the work you’re doing will have any real impact on the ground. Is it going to make this world a better place? How? Think whether you feel that you are being valued enough at your job in academia. Only if there’s no demand for PhD or PostDoc jobs will the universities raise the payment. These jobs are hard. Perhaps this is happening already but if that’s the case, it’s happening really slowly.

### The last decade of service to humans, animals and ecosystems
Looking at my life’s and work’s achievements, it probably comes down to the following things that I’ve contributed to creating change – many of those without pay and in my own time:
