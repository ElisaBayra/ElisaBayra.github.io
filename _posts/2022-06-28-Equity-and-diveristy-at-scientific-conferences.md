## A call on conferences for more equity and the inclusion of diversity
This blog post is dedicated to of all the people who care about equity and inclusion of diversity, especially with regards to collaborations with researchers and practitioners from low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income economy countries. Here, I tell the back story about how the largest and oldest coral reef research society, the International Coral Reef Society (ICRS), changed their operational model for running their International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS22)to improve participation and access to delegates from developing countries by waiving the online registration fees. This change followed a public request of one unhappy symposium chair. Me.

### And this is how everything began

It would have probably been by chance that I found myself at a Spanish-speaking meeting of the Reef Future Conference in Florida in 2018. Luckily, my Spanish was fairly good as I lived for 3 years in Colombia to collect the data for my PhD in 2010. At the meeting, I listened to 25 scientists and practitioners from 5 Latin American countries who were lamenting that nobody in the world has ever heard about their massive coral reef restoration projects. It seems, non-English conservation papers are mostly ignored. At least, that's what work by [Amano et al. 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000933 "Link to Amano et al. 2016 paper") is showing us - 36% of all research in biodiversity conservation published in 2014 was not in English and we've been ignoring it. So in 2018, I decided to help out - I started interviewing the Latin American practitioners to get their research out there. I sat together with each of them and asked them questions about about cost, duration, spatial extent and feasibility of their projects in reaching their overall goals. Together, we wrote a multi-author scientific paper [Bayraktarov et al.2020b](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228477 "Link to Bayraktarov et al 2020b paper") reviewing the coral reef restoration efforts of Latin American Countries and Territories over the following 2 years.

But I wanted to go further in giving those people the chance to have a voice at international meetings. In 2020, we submitted a symposium to the largest coral reef conference, the ICRS20, to showcase the coral reef restoration efforts in the Caribbean and Eastern Tropical Pacific and got 17 presenters from lower-middle-income countries such as Puerto Rico, Mexico, Bonaire, Curacao, and Colombia. ICRS20 was postponed to ICRS21 due to COVID-19 and was entirely online, however, none of the accepted delegates could afford the 350 Euro participation fee - so our symposium changed completely.
 
In 2022, the ICRS was repeated as a hybrid event hosted in Germany and the online participation fees jumped to 395 Euro (the in person fees are 830 Euro) - in the hope to be able to pay back some of the cost from the 2020 cancellation that could never be recovered. I should note that 395 Euro represent 70-80% of the average monthly income in the countries where the delegates were from. The ICRS had resubmitted all accepted symposia, presentations and posters that were accepted in the virtual ICRS21. But I doubted that anyone from a poor country would be ever able to afford those costs.
 
I felt very strongly that we needed a cultural change for more inclusion of diversity and towards more equity. This is why I was prepared to step down as a symposium chair if ICRS didn't waive the online participation fees for delegates from lower income countries, so I wrote a public letter expressing my concerns. At the time of writing, I had no idea whether my call would lead to any change but at least I was full of hope that it would stimulate a discourse for a potential change to happen in the near future. And it did.

### The difference between Equality vs Equity
 
The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 is to “Reduce inequality within and among countries” – and designed in particular (Target 10.6) to “Ensure enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions” and (10a) to “Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements”. 

I've been thinking a lot about equality vs equity lately and discovered that there's a huge difference in meaning:

Equality is giving all people the same resources or opportunities, that is - all people no matter their country of origin can register for the ICRS and have to pay the same registration fee.

Equity recognises that people are different and that some might have difficult circumstances. So equity allocates the exact resources needed to reach an equal outcome, that is - people from developing countries can apply to get their online participation fees waived so that they can partake in the scientific discourse with everyone else.

So what we really want is more equity. We should aspire to build a society where everyone can be given the exact resources needed to reach an equal outcome, despite of their circumstances. But I can see how this can be a fine line between what is appropriate and what is too much.
