## Elisa's 40 Under 40

40 under 40 is a list by the [Fortune magazine](https://fortune.com/ "Official website of Fortune") on the most influential young leaders of the year in the tech industry. Their list doesn't expand to scientists or anyone working outsite of tech and has been often referred to as being subjective about power and influence. Today, 40 days before my 40th birthday, I reflect on my life as a female scientist and ponder what may lie head of me. These are my very personal 40 days under 40 years of age musings.

### The rebellious teenager
Leading up to my 20ies, I...

- Dealing with being a stranger in my own 'new' country - faking being a German
- Metal and motorbikes
- Wanting to become an Astronaut
- Pioneer of Live-action role plays
- Deciding to move to Berlin and study Biophysics (aka the most difficult subject ever) after talking to Astronaut Uwe Merboldt

### My 20ies and the search for a purpose in life

- 2005 Living abroad on the Canary Islands and learning Spanish (and surfing and diving)
- 2008 Finishing Biophysics with the discovery that Influenca virus proteins chases the liquid disordered phase of biological membranes
- 2008 Interview for the Young Trainee Program at the European Space Administration - and failing

- The transition from astronaut to aquanaut - prepping for becoming a European Scientific Diver after course in underwater methods on Elba
- 2008 European Scientific Diving training on Helgoland
- First job as a scientific diver at Rostock Institute for...
- 2008-2010 the study of Marine Microbiology at Max Planck investigating that bacteria in shallow-water hydrothermal vents are performing optimally at a much lower pHD that you'd expect for that biogeochemical process (Sulphate reduction) which is usuing happening at a much higher pH, how fascinating and versatile those little buggers are
- Job as Scientific Diver in Helgoland and in the Artic helping Duygu Sevilgen with her PhD-field work studying the impacts of climate change on microphytobenthos
- 2010 falling into an identity crisis because of not seeing a clear path to making the world a better place and living life with a purpose
- 2010 trip to Malaysia - encountering the sheer beauty of coral reefs
- 2010 starting a PhD in Coral Reef Ecology studying the coral reef ecosystem of Tayrona National Park in the Colomian Caribbean
- 

### My mid-30ies and finding ground under my feet as an academic
- 2013 following love and moving to Australia in the last PhD year; finishing within 2yrs and 9 months 
- 2014 the hunt for jobs as a recent PhD gradudate who's an outsider at one of Australia's most prestigious uni in ecology
- 2014 Global Change institute and the shift towards conservation
- 2015 Endeavour Fellowship to study the multi-factor effects of climate change, eutrophication on the interaction between corals and algae
- 2016 Identity crisis after participating at the Coral Reef Symposium in Hawaii --> towards conservation data
- 2016 starting the new job on the Threatened Species Index despite feeling a lot of pushback that it might not be possible and finding out a year later that my project lead, Hugh Possigham had taken a new job as the Chief Scientist of the eNGO TNC --> need to step up in leadership
- 2016 starting improvised theatre to overcome fear from public speaking and stakeholder engagement
- 2018 releas of the first index on birds and securign a continuation grant to develop a mammal and a plant index
- 2020 index project partner urges me to apply for a job as a Program Manager of a digital innivation program called EcoCommons; imposter syndrome; 

### Leaving academia for impact (while feeling like an imposter)
- new job in management - new life
- working on work-life balance with a psychologist
- imposter syndrome; gathering evidence; the book of winning
- 

### The last decade of service to humans, animals and ecosystems
- helped a friend becoming a PR in Australia
- Over the last 8 years, I have worked as a Conservation Scientist at the University of Queensland and Griffith University and have contributed to protecting and managing the Australian environment by carrying out research and pulling data together to identify how people can improve the restoration of coral reefs, how likely those projects are to succeed and how expensive they are and also on the motivations that drive people to restore coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, saltmarsh and oyster reefs. My research brought together the first ever cost & feasibility database for marine coastal restoration in 2015 which was used to inform the Australian Reef Trust’s Offsets calculator and was updated in 2020 in my own personal time and under no payment.
 
More recently, I led the development of Australia’s Threatened Species Index (TSX) which is the world’s first biodiversity indicator that tracks changes in Australian threatened species populations and tells us how our threatened birds, mammals and plants are going. Those trends also informed the recent Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act Review carried out by Graeme Samuel, which featured my submission as an independent researcher and on behalf of the TSX team to identify gaps in data, monitoring and management as well as a lack of standardised reporting on species population trends in Australia. The TSX since its first launch in 2018 by the former Australian Threatened Species Commissioner, Sally Box, has now been adopted as an official statistic by the Australian’s government’s Corporate Reporting and was also used and a performance criterion by a number of states (example from the Victorian Government here). My work on the TSX has mobilised data from over 300 data custodians on 254 bird, mammal and plant species and subspecies from over 20,000 locations across Australia, and from more than 400,000 surveys carried out over 50 years. This data, often sitting in reports, in drawers or on people’s personal computers would have been hidden from the public, if my team didn’t bring it all together. Most importantly, this work has produced a platform for a national ‘conversation’ about threatened and Near Threatened species, and thereby has increased community awareness and appreciation of our threatened biodiversity to create a mandate for investment in its protection.
 
Currently, I lead a team at the Griffith University which builds a digital innovation platform that will hopefully become the platform of choice for ecological and environmental modelling. We build virtual laboratories to empower researchers and policy decision-makers to spend less time on searching and wrangling of data as well as on configuring models and invest more time into solving environmental problems through world-leading modelling tools and access to highly curated datasets. In two weeks, on the 29th of Nov 2-4pm we will be opening this platform to people who volunteered to test it.
 
In my free time, I contribute to citizen science where I monitor local coral reefs and write reports for our local and state government or lend a hand to the Woodfordian Treehuggers in maintaining the conservation area of Woodford.

### What comes next?
- life isn't linear; often things happen and we don't see the bigger picture and that's fine
- TEDx here I come!

### Recommendations for my 20-years old self on how to navigate life
- be more daring; failing is ok; you learn, you pick up yourself and you try again
- if you don't ask, the answer is always gonna be No
- scientic publications are great but they don't create much impact, unless they are picked up by a billionaire like Frank Mars
- professional goals need to be pursued in parallel with your personal goals (creative arts, starting a family, study) - it would be too late for you to pursue personal goals after you've finish all your professional bucket list
- you can always do more than you think you can - but only if you set clear goals early on and do every day a bit
- Time is the ultimate unit of life - think wisely how you spend every sec, min, hrs of your life. Life is so much more worth living if you can fill it with joy, play, silliness, daring greatly, failing, not taking yourself too serious. Feeling the fear and doing it anyway. Being bold, being vocal, stepping up for your thoughts and what you believe is fair.
- Laugh a lot, challenge the status quo, speak up when you need to, consume life's experiences with a big spoon and for fucks sake, get yourself a psychologist - everybody deserves to have one! If you get one, they will help you to navigate through all this jungle of confusion and stir through all those people who demand to have a piece of your valuable life time. Every minute of your life is precious - hold it dearly to your heart! Use it to act on impulses to seed the seeds for your dreams. Your time is valuable. You are valuable. Always. Don't waste it or give it away with no prospect of return in form of experience, reputation, joy, growth, and sheer entertainment

# ### Thoughts about biological expiry date of a childfree woman
# - Not for the faint hearted (add some stats from the ABC ladies we need to talk podcast)
# - There were times when I was workign 10-12 hrs days because I believed the scientice that I was developing; achieving scientific acolates often takes so # much work and time from you that you often can't focus on your personal goals, dreams, wants and desires.
# - Freezing eggs and sperm donors
# - Society is not equipped to give the same treatment of a scientist woman to a scientist man - they will always be that a trade-off. I was not willing to  # pay that trade-off and sacrifice my academic career for family; probably would regards this as a mistake nowadays.
