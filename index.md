Welcome to my personal blog! 
My name is Elisa and I am a Conservation Scientist | Data Diplomat | Developer of Virtual Labs based in Brisbane, Australia

I'm posting reflections and curious things that I encounter on the way of my journey in this beautiful world while making first clumsy steps using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart "Intro to using GitHub Pages")! You will see me posting about Biodiversity data, Conservation science, Coral reefs, Digital innovation platforms, Marine restoration, Scientific diving, Threatened species, Virtual laboratories but also things that not many scientists talk about publicly like ecological grief, overcoming self-doubt and imposter syndrome and what Imrovised Threatre teaches us to embrace failure and bring more play and joy into our lives.

My goal is to post once per month.
